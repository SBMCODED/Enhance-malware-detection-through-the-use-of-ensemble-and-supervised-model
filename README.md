In this project,it consists of 4 classification 
0-bengin
1-defacement 
2-malware 
3-phishing 
after this classification, different machine learning models are used to perform the accuracy of the data. ensemble models and supervised model are been used..
ensemble model like 
1. gradient boosting
2. stacking
3. blending
4. bagging
and supervised model like
1. principal component analysis
2. logistics regression
3. naive bayes
in ensemble model, there are some based model that are combined before it is been called ensemble model.
based model like
1. decision tree
2. random forest
3. logistics regression..
the aim is to ensure that ensemble model have higher accuracy than supervised machine learning..
